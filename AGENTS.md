# AGENTS.md

## Project

A static site that publishes **guided learning materials**. One material per directory, each a
sequenced roadmap rather than a reference dump, with per-step progress tracking saved in the
reader's browser.

Astro + Starlight, no server, no database, no runtime. Output is HTML in `dist/`, deployable to
GitHub Pages or any static host.

The content is the product. The code exists to render it, stay out of its way, and make adding
the next material cheap.

This repo is a **starter template**. It ships four example materials, kept so the conventions
below have something to point at. Two of them (`fastapi-support-assistant`, `n8n-ai-operations`)
are AI materials and carry two extra conventions — see *AI materials* below. Replace all four
with your own; the examples are illustrative, not owned by this repo.

Everything branded — title, tagline, description, repo URL, progress storage namespace — lives
in `src/site.config.ts`. Change it there, nowhere else.

---

## The loop

`npm run verify` is the single source of truth. It runs `astro check` → production build →
internal link check.

**Run it after every change. Do not report work as complete without a green run.**

```
npm run verify    # everything. the one you care about.
npm run dev       # local dev server, hot reload
npm run build     # production build into dist/
npm run preview   # serve dist/ locally
npm run check     # types + content schema only, faster
```

If it fails, fix it. Never disable a check to make it pass — if a rule looks wrong, raise it,
don't route around it. A gate that gets bypassed once gets bypassed always.

---

## Stack

| Layer | Choice |
|---|---|
| Framework | Astro 7 (static output) |
| Docs theme | Starlight 0.41 |
| Content | Markdown + MDX in `src/content/docs/` |
| Search | Pagefind (bundled with Starlight, build-time) |
| Styling | Starlight CSS custom properties + one override file |
| Hosting | GitHub Pages via Actions; any static host for VPS |
| Hooks | Lefthook — `pre-push` runs `scripts/verify-project.sh` |

**Never add:** a UI framework (React/Vue/Svelte) — no page here needs client state; a CSS
framework — Starlight's tokens cover it; a CMS; SSR or any adapter — the site must stay
statically deployable; an analytics or font CDN without discussing the privacy and CSP cost.

## Non-negotiable conventions

**Catalog**
- `src/catalog.ts` is the only place material metadata lives. The sidebar and the landing page
  both read from it. **Never** hardcode a material into `astro.config.mjs` or a component.
- Adding a material means: content directory + one `materials` entry. Nothing else.
- **Slug is `<framework>-<use-case>`**, kebab-case: `spring-boot-ticketing`,
  `laravel-spreadsheet-migration`. The framework, not the language — nobody searches "java
  spring ticketing". Title is `Framework — System`: *Spring Boot — Event Ticketing Marketplace*.
- Renaming a slug breaks shared links and orphans saved progress. Both are handled in one
  place each, and both must be updated together: `renamedMaterials` in `astro.config.mjs`
  (emits a redirect from every old page URL) and `RENAMED_MATERIALS` in `src/lib/progress.ts`
  (moves saved progress onto the new slug). Entries stay forever.

**Content**
- **Every material names its examples.** A domain category — "a booking system", "a ticketing
  system" — is not a domain. Name **three concrete instances** of it and run them through the
  whole material: *Northside Barbershop / Bright Smile Dental / Loft Yoga*, *Hamlet at the Lyric
  Theatre / Riverside Arena / The Foundry*. Rules:
  - Pick them so they **disagree** on the axes the material teaches. Each one exists to break a
    rule the others don't: one is the simple case, one carries the awkward constraint, one
    doesn't fit the obvious model at all. Write down, per example, which rule that is.
  - They live in four places: a `## What you are building, concretely` section on `index.md`
    (a table: the instance → its setup → what it forces you to handle), a
    `## The three example <things>` section in `roadmap/overview.md`, the stories, expected
    outcomes and gating tests of the steps, and the material's `AGENTS.md` template.
  - **Seed them in the first step that creates data**, and keep them for the rest of the
    roadmap. A reader must be able to run the thing, not just read about it.
  - State the rule that they are never special-cased in code. `if ($tenant->slug === …)` means
    the model is wrong, not the example.
  - Also list the wider real-world set (*driving schools, physiotherapists, vets…* /
    *cinema, conferences, museum timed entry…*) so a reader can point their own build at one.
- Frontmatter `title` and `description` on every page. `description` is what search and
  social cards show.
- **No `<h1>` in the body** — Starlight renders it from `title`.
- `sidebar.order` is scoped to the page's directory, starting at 1. The material's `index.md`
  is `sidebar.order: 0`, `label: Getting Started` — it *is* the Getting Started page (what /
  why / structure / how to read a step / start here); there is no separate `getting-started.md`.
- One `##` per top-level unit (step, chapter) so the right-hand TOC is a real table of contents.
  A roadmap step heading is `## Step N — Title` (`N` parseable; a sub-step is `5b`). The per-step
  progress tracker builds its unit list from these headings under `roadmap/` — see
  `src/lib/roadmapSteps.ts`.
- Step anatomy, in order: **Story** (user-story format) · **Mode** (`LEARN`/`BUILD`) ·
  **Why now** · **Concepts** · **Libraries** · **Expected outcome** (the pieces to build; add a
  *high-level* structure sketch where "where does this go" is open — never `**Build:**`) ·
  **Verification** (L1/L2/L4/Done-when table) · optional **Harness impact**. Rubrics live in
  `reference/rubrics.md` as `ACC-NN` + `AP-NN-x`, one section per step, a lookup not a checklist.
  Setup pages use `## The goal, and the end state` / `## Why` / `## How`.
- Prose is plain, common English for a non-native reader — short sentences, no AI-slop idioms
  ("the whole game", "cargo cult", "under the hood"). Terse is fine; fragments are fine.
- Content is the author's voice. Fix broken links, frontmatter, and structure — **do not
  rewrite prose** unless asked; when asked, keep the register and every technical claim.
- Use the `add-material` skill for a new material or a structural restructure.

**AI materials** — anything whose product calls a model at runtime. Two extra rules, both
non-negotiable.

- **Theory lives inside the roadmap, and it comes first.** A reader who can build the thing but
  cannot say what it costs a business, what it replaces, or when it is the wrong answer, has
  half a skill. So the first roadmap section is `concepts.md`: numbered `LEARN` steps covering
  the problem in business terms, how the technique works, what you could buy instead, when
  *not* to build it, and how to scope it with a client. They are real steps — numbered,
  tracked, with their own `ACC-NN` — and their deliverable is a written document, not code.
  There is **no separate `concepts/` sidebar section**: a reader who can skip the theory does.
- **Every AI material has a cost monitoring and optimisation section.** Not a paragraph in an
  operations step — its own roadmap section, with at minimum: where the spend is visible
  (provider console, the usage fields on each response, your own per-request ledger), how to
  attribute it per customer and per stage, the order the levers are pulled in (free wins before
  anything that trades quality), and a decision the reader has to write down and defend. A
  material that teaches someone to build a thing whose bill they cannot explain is not finished.

**Links**
- Internal links in Markdown are **relative**, never absolute. The site is served from `/` on a
  VPS and `/<repo>/` on GitHub Pages; an absolute link works on exactly one of them.
- Count `../` from the page's **URL**, not its file path. `<slug>/setup/foo.md` is served at
  `/<slug>/setup/foo/`, so a sibling section is `../../reference/bar/`.
- When a link must be absolute (the 404 page), build it from `import.meta.env.BASE_URL` in an
  `.mdx` or `.astro` file.
- `scripts/check-links.mjs` enforces both rules. It runs in `verify` and in CI.

**Deployment**
- Both base paths must build. `BASE_PATH` and `SITE_URL` are the only knobs; never hardcode a
  domain or a subdirectory anywhere else.
- Output stays static. No adapter, no server-rendered route, no runtime env var.

**Components**
- `.astro` only, scoped `<style>` blocks, Starlight CSS custom properties for colour and
  spacing. No hardcoded hex, no global CSS outside `src/styles/custom.css`.
- A component that exists to render catalog data reads it from `src/catalog.ts`.

## Working style

- **Small changes.** One concern per change. Large diffs can't be reviewed properly.
- **Explain before generating.** State the approach; get agreement; then write.
- **Say when you're unsure.** A flagged uncertainty is useful. A confident wrong answer costs hours.
- **Don't invent APIs.** Starlight's config surface changes between minor versions — check
  `node_modules/@astrojs/starlight/` before claiming an option exists.
- **No scope creep.** Don't add i18n, versioning, or a blog because the framework supports it.
- **Never bypass a quality gate.** No `--no-verify`, no skipped link check.

## Decisions

The sidebar scoping, the base-path handling, the catalog module and the progress store were each
chosen against a plausible alternative. Don't reverse one without reading how it works first.

When a decision is made in conversation, offer to record it under `docs/`. Undocumented
decisions get silently reversed three PRs later.

## Skills

Agent skills live in `.claude/skills/`. See [`.claude/skills/README.md`](.claude/skills/README.md)
for what each one does.

Reach for them rather than improvising:

| Task | Skill |
|---|---|
| Deciding *what* material to build next | `brainstorm` |
| Adding or restructuring a learning material | `add-material` |
| Checking the site before saying done | `verify-site` |
